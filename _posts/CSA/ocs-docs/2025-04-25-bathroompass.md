### What is it?
The [Bathroom Pass Scanner](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/portfolio_2025/) is the endpoint for the bathroom pass functionality. It handles all requests to leave to the bathroom by collecting and authenticating each user based on their scanned id information.

1. Keep student ID or student ID barcode on hand
2. Scan student ID ONCE to be added to the queue

Second Pathway: You are added to the "Away" Queue
If you are added to the "Away" list, this means that you are officially on your bathroom break. In order to indicate that you have returned, you must rescan your student ID when you have returned.
